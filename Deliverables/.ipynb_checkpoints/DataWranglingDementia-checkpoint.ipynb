It is commonly used in medicine and allied health to screen for dementia. It is also used to estimate the severity and progression of cognitive impairment and to follow the course of cognitive changes in an individual over time; thus making it an effective way to document an individual’s response to treatment. The MMSE’s purpose has been not, on its own, to provide a diagnosis for any particular nosological entity.\n",

Low to very low scores correlate closely with the presence of dementia, although other mental disorders can also lead to abnormal findings on MMSE testing. The presence of purely physical problems can also interfere with interpretation if not properly noted; for example, a patient may be physically unable to hear or read instructions properly, or may have a motor deficit that affects writing and drawing skills.\n",

    ">The ICV measure, sometimes referred to as total intracranial volume (TIV), refers to the estimated volume of the cranial cavity as outlined by the supratentorial dura matter or cerebral contour when dura is not clearly detectable. ICV is often used in studies involved with analysis of the cerebral structure under different imaging modalities, such as Magnetic Resonance (MR), MR and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), MR and Single-photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), Ultrasound and Computed Tomography (CT). ICV consistency during aging makes it a reliable tool for correction of head size variation across subjects in studies that rely on morphological features of the brain. ICV, along with age and gender are reported as covariates to adjust for regression analyses in investigating progressive neurodegenerative brain disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, aging and cognitive impairment. ICV has also been utilized as an independent voxel based morphometric feature to evaluate age-related changes in the structure of premorbid brai, determine characterizing atrophy patterns in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), delineate structural abnormalities in the white matter (WM) in schizophrenia, epilepsy, and gauge cognitive efficacy[source](https://www.kaggle.com/ruslankl/dementia-prediction-w-tree-based-models)."
