    "> This dataset consists of a longitudinal collection of 150 subjects aged 60 to 96. We see data type of each feature along with non-null counts. In this longitudinal study each subject was scanned on two or more visits, separated by at least one year for a total of 373 imaging sessions. For each subject, 3 or 4 individual T1-weighted MRI scans obtained in single scan sessions are included. The subjects are all right-handed and include both men and women. 72 of the subjects were characterized as nondemented throughout the study. 64 of the included subjects were characterized as demented at the time of their initial visits and remained so for subsequent scans, including 51 individuals with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease. Another 14 subjects were characterized as nondemented at the time of their initial visit and were subsequently characterized as demented at a later visit."

    "> The need for data pre-processing is determined by the type of the model being used. Some models like tree-based models are robust to the characteristics of the predictor data. Others, like linear regression are sensitive to predictors' characteristics. For instance, in linear regression it is good to center and scale the predictors. By **centering**, we the average value is substracted from all the features so that predictors could have zero mean. **Scaling** is about standard deviation, where we divide each value of the predictor variable by its standard deviation so to improve the numerical stability of some calculations. The downside is to lose interpretability of the individual values as the data are no longer in the original units.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> If the data is **skewed**, replacing the data with *log*, *square_root*, or *inverse* may help to remove the skewness.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Outliers** are samples that are exceptionally far from the mainstream of the data. There are statistical techniques available to identify outliers, however, using visualization techniques helps too. *Tree based*  models are resistant to outliers because they create splits of the training data and the prediction equation is a set of logical statements such as \"if predictor A is greater than X, predict the class to be Y\", so the outlier does not usually have an exceptional influence on the model. Also SVM models for classification generally ignore a portion of the training set samples when creating a prediction equation. So the samples are disregarded may be far away from the decision boundary and outside of majority of the data.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Data Reduction** is another way to transform predictors before modeling processes. The goal here is to compress predictor features space such that the new feature space captures a majority of the information in the original variables. PCA is a commonly used one to reduce feature space to smaller one and to capture the most variance that still captures the necessary information in the original data. Here we want to get features that explain the most variability iin the data. We look at the component weights ti determine which predictors are most important to each Principle Component.  PCA creates components that are uncorrelated to represent the most important features. The downside is, witout proper domain knowledge of the problem being solved, to end up with irrelevant features to the problem as PCA does have any understanding of the meanings of features and the problem domain. For instance, if the original predictors are on measurement scales that differ in orders of magnitude then the first few components will focus on summarizing the higher magnitude predictors while latter components will summarize lower variance predictors. This can be thought of money values vs heigt of people.. Simply, the PCA weights will be larger for the higher variability predictors on the first few components. So to speak PCA cares about not the relationships withing the data but it cares about identifying data structure based on measurement scales.  It is best to first transform skwewed predictors and then center and scale the predictiors before PCA. Number of PCs to choose can be identified with the Cross-Validation process. Also a SCREE plot could work too."

    ">The Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE) or Folstein test is a 30-point questionnaire that is used extensively in clinical and research settings to measure cognitive impairment. It is commonly used in medicine and allied health to screen for dementia. It is also used to estimate the severity and progression of cognitive impairment and to follow the course of cognitive changes in an individual over time; thus making it an effective way to document an individual’s response to treatment. The MMSE’s purpose has been not, on its own, to provide a diagnosis for any particular nosological entity.\n",

    ">- MMSE score between $ 19–23  $ points mild  cognitive impairment.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The raw score may also need to be corrected for educational attainment and age. That is, a maximal score of 30 points can never rule out dementia. Low to very low scores correlate closely with the presence of dementia, although other mental disorders can also lead to abnormal findings on MMSE testing. The presence of purely physical problems can also interfere with interpretation if not properly noted; for example, a patient may be physically unable to hear or read instructions properly, or may have a motor deficit that affects writing and drawing skills.\n",

    "Estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV) was computed by scaling the manually measured intracranial volume of the atlas by the determinant of the affine transform connecting each individual's brain to the atlas.

    ">Intracranial volume (ICV) is an important normalization measure used in morphometric analyses to correct for head size in studies of Alzheimer Disease (AD). Inaccurate ICV estimation could introduce bias in the outcome. **ICV, along with age and gender are reported as covariates to adjust for regression analyses in investigating progressive neurodegenerative brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, aging and cognitive impairment** [source.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4423585/)\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The ICV measure, sometimes referred to as total intracranial volume (TIV), refers to the estimated volume of the cranial cavity as outlined by the supratentorial dura matter or cerebral contour when dura is not clearly detectable. ICV is often used in studies involved with analysis of the cerebral structure under different imaging modalities, such as Magnetic Resonance (MR), MR and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), MR and Single-photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), Ultrasound and Computed Tomography (CT). ICV consistency during aging makes it a reliable tool for correction of head size variation across subjects in studies that rely on morphological features of the brain. ICV, along with age and gender are reported as covariates to adjust for regression analyses in investigating progressive neurodegenerative brain disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, aging and cognitive impairment. ICV has also been utilized as an independent voxel based morphometric feature to evaluate age-related changes in the structure of premorbid brai, determine characterizing atrophy patterns in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), delineate structural abnormalities in the white matter (WM) in schizophrenia, epilepsy, and gauge cognitive efficacy[source](https://www.kaggle.com/ruslankl/dementia-prediction-w-tree-based-models).\n",

However, not all brain volume changes indicates dementia [source.](https://www.alzforum.org/news/research-news/brain-changes-speak-volumes-about-normal-aging-and-dementia) According to the Oregon Brain Aging Study  age, dementia diagnosis, and AD pathologies closely correlated with enlargement of the brain ventricles but not with total brain volume loss (white and gray matter).\n",

    "> Handling missing data is a tedious task. There are severeal methods in statistics but in general we call this process imputation. Missing data can cause multiple problems in statistical modelin process such as introducing significant bias and reductions in efficiency. Therefore, imputation is a way to avoid problems may arise from listwise deletion of missing values.\n",

    ">     - Median Substitution\n",

    "Multiple imputation can be used in cases where the data is missing completely, missing at random, and even when the data is missing not at random. However, the primary method of multiple imputation is multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE).An important thing to note is that MICE should be implemented only when the missing data follow the missing at random mechanism. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three assumptions on why the data is missing, Missing At Random, Missing Not at Random and Missing Completely at Random. In our case, MMSE and SES was supposed to collected from a subject during interviews and now let's take a look at other variables to determine our assumtion on why the data is not available. After analysing the table below, we might assume that the unavailable data in `SES` column is missing mostly like because subjects did not want to declare their financial statue as you can see most of them high school graduates. This type of missing data goes under `Missing Not at Random` as the subjects seem to choose not giving that information. As for the missing values in `MMSE`, there are only two subjects who are also missed giving `SES` information whereas others who did not report their finances were able take the test. These two subjects look like Missing Completely At Random. Identifying these assumptions could help analyst in choosing the method to deal with those missing values in data. \n",
